Welcome! I think you have two options: []() and [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator) :-)
Some important/interesting article about these situations:

Well, I understand you. All beginnings are hard, especially in programming.
But don't be angry, this site is about short and focused questions and answers.
That's why they voted you down. I don't believe in it (and I never use it),
because of my pedagogical viewpoint, but this is necessary to maintain this
huge portal. However, I suggest you again to join an online course.
For example: [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/)
